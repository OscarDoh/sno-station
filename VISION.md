# Vision

You already pay for two coding agents. They sit in two terminals and never talk. When one
hits its rate limit, you copy the last twenty lines into the other and start over. When one
reviews its own work, it says "looks good." Sno Station exists because that is the wrong
shape for how agents should work on a developer's machine.

**One squad, not two tabs.** Sno Station gives your Claude Code and Codex one shared, encrypted
memory and a way to talk to each other, on your laptop, with no daemon and no cloud. Three things
follow from that:

1. **Rate limit? Keep going.** When one agent hits its cap, the other picks up with the context
   intact. This is the first reason anyone runs two agents, and it should be a non-event.
2. **Two reviewers, two harnesses.** A reviewer from another harness does not share the author's
   blind spots and has no reason to be kind. Fewer mistakes reach you.
3. **No single vendor decides your workflow.** The squad outlives any one model's pricing, limits,
   or outage.

**The workspace learns; the models don't change.** Every night a loop reads the agents' own sessions,
finds the mistakes that repeat, and proposes changes to the agents' own skill files. A human accepts
or rejects. Over weeks the shared workspace gets sharper while the underlying models stay exactly what
the vendors shipped. That is the part we think matters most, and the part we are building in public.

**Memory is the floor, not the sign.** Good memory forgets on purpose: it drops what was cancelled
and keeps what still holds. We measure that, and we publish the numbers with their source. But we do not lead with
it. We lead with the squad.

**Yours, and it stays yours.** Local by default. Encrypted from first use with a key that never leaves
your machine. Apache-2.0, edge to edge. Whatever cloud features arrive later stay optional, and
the product is complete without them.
